The [Benjamin Cooper Academic Ambassador Award](http://www.pace-nsc.org/2018-cooper-award-winners/)
is an annual award presented by PACE to recognize an individual or organization 
whose above-and-beyond contributions to the quizbowl community embody, by 
example, the ideals of academic competition. The original Cooper Award was named
in honor of Benjamin Cooper, a student at Georgetown Day School who had been 
named captain of his team prior to his untimely death on August 12, 1997. The 
Cooper Academic Ambassador Award has been awarded at every NSC since PACE’s 
founding. PACE is pleased to present the 2021 Benjamin Cooper Academic Ambassador 
Award to Ben Herman, co-founder of Greater Pennsylvania Quiz Bowl (GPQB), for his longtime dedication to outreach in Pennsylvania, especially his support of many first-time hosts of competitions in Pennsylvania and his work increasing the profile of quizbowl via the GPQB blog.

In 2004, PACE added the Benjamin Cooper Young Ambassador Award, which
specifically recognizes the contributions of under the age of 25. Many winners of
the “Young Cooper” award were high school or college students at the time when
they were recognized.

PACE is pleased to present the 2021 Benjamin Cooper Young Ambassador Award to Emily Gunter of Salem High School (Salem, VA), for her extraordinary commitment to outreach, both on a local level in central Virginia and on a national level by writing articles on outreach and helping tournament directors handle online logistics.

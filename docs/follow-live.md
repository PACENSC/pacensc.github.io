# Follow Live

There are three ways you can follow the action live:

* Keep an eye on your favorite teams by going to the [live standings page](http://pace-nsc.org/live). There, you can see real-time scores and standings of all the teams as the weekend progresses.
* Follow along with [our livebloggers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1532909314582667264). [Akshata Pisharody](https://twitter.com/PACENSC_AP), [Ben Weiner](https://twitter.com/PACENSC_BW), [Ryan Ritter](https://twitter.com/PACENSC_RJR), and [Sadie Britton](https://twitter.com/PACENSC_SadieB) will be covering the action all weekend, while [the official PACE Twitter](https://twitter.com/PACENSC) will be providing highlights and announcements.
* Games from Lambert will be streamed [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBUe-NYhkYw). For question security purposes, these streams will be delayed about 40 minutes from live gameplay.

# Follow Live

There are two ways you can follow the action live:

* Keep an eye on your favorite teams by going to [the live standings page](https://pace-nsc.org/live). There, you can see real-time scores and standings, and even links to spectate games on Zoom.
* You can also watch livestreams of gameplay [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjPjiMYO4MA46kOJDsXaxOw). We will be streaming matches all day from [room 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnKKw6daVlw) and [room 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-zhd5Kbf1Y). For question security purposes, these streams will be on an about 30-minute delay.

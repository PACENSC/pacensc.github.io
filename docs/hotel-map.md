# Getting to NSC

The 2019 NSC will be held at the [Hyatt Regency Reston](https://goo.gl/maps/tAp4NSVPqVH2) in Reston, VA. You can reach the hotel via a hotel shuttle from Dulles Airport (IAD), the Silver Line Metro to WMATA Bus, and/or Uber/Lyft/cab.


If you are traveling by bus or rail to Washington, DC, we recommend traveling to Dulles after arriving in DC and taking the hotel shuttle from there. Various ways to travel between downtown DC and Dulles are outlined [here](https://freetoursbyfoot.com/transportation-washington-d-c-dulles-airport/).
